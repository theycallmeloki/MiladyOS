The system had been powered up throughout the flight and had been in the zero optics mode since the star/horizon navigation sightings at 3l hours.

The shaft loop has been shown to be more sensitive than the trunnion to harmonics of the 800-hertz reference voltages introduced into the forward loop; however, because the level of the required null offset voltage is well above that available by induction, this mechanism is considered unlikely.\\n------\\n'},\n",

This onset was very well marked on all but the 1.5 kHz channel. Following onset, the noise levels at l20 and at 5l kHz tended to decrease slowly in intensity for some 20 seconds. However, the noise levels at 27 and at 6 kHz increased and reached their maxima after about 15 seconds. Furthermore, substantial noise at 1.5 kHz was first apparent at 5 seconds after lift-off and also peaked out in about l5 secorids.\\n------\\nResult 2:\\nIf the Saturn V vehicle is charged to a potential of several million volts, corona discharges will be produced which, in turn, generate radio noise. The onset of these discharges should occur very soon after liftoff and reach a maximum when the launch vehicle is still close to the ground. Radio noise records strongly support this conclusion. The sudden onset of the noise probably corresponds closely to lift-off. It is interesting that, at about 15 seconds after lift-off, the noise became enhanced at the lower rather than the higher frequencies. This phenomenon implies that larger discharges occur at these times.

However, the use of the heaters in detanking required that the switches open under a load of 6 amperes at 65 V dc, twice the normal flight operating conditions, for each heater.

A 20-minute segment of high-bit-rate data was received just prior to entry, and an unaccountable pitch-up torque of 0.00l deg/sec2 was observed. The possible contributing causes for this torque could have been gravity gradients, atmospheric trimming, venting through the umbilical, venting through the tunnel hatch, and a gradual propellant leak. However, none of these is considered to have been a single cause, and either a combination of these causes was present Or some undetermined venting took place.\\n------\\nResult 2:\\nThe most likely candidate is the half-speed resolver, which is used only for the shaft axis and only to provide an unambiguous zero reference. The reference voltage is applied to the rotor through slip rings (fig. 14-3), connected as shown in figure 14-4. If any resistance is present in the common ground path through the slip ring, a portion of the reference voltage will appear across the quadrature winding and induce a finite output (different than zero). Zero output is equivalent to zero degrees in shaft rotation.\\n\\nSimulated changes in slip ring impedance were made on the half-speed resolver in the shaft loop (fig. 14-4). An impedance of 50 ohms produced an offset of approximately plus 0.5 degree in sextant shaft angle. The trunnion loop does not use this type of resolver or connection.\\n------\\n'},\n",

A platform coarse alignment was performed at about l35 hours, and the error-counter-enable status bit was set. The digital autopilot was activated 2 hours later, but with the error cournters already enabled, no initialization took place and a bias was introduced into the attitude error loop. The attitude errors displayed to the crew at the completion of the attitude maneuver prior to the seventh midcourse correction reflected a bias in the pitch, roll, and yaw axes of plus l.3, plus 2l.2, and minus l2.0 degrees, respectively.\\n\\nSpacecraft dynamics were very small during the service module jettison and lunar module undocking sequence.

The system had been powered up throughout the flight and had been in the zero optics mode since the star/horizon navigation sightings at 3l hours. Crew observation of the manual readout subsequently confirmed that the fluctuation was actually caused by motion of the shaft. The circumstances and time of occurrence were almost identical to a similar situation which occurred during the Apollo l2 mission.\\n------\\nResult 2:\\nA simplified schematic of the optics shaft servo loop mechanization is shown in figure l4-2. In the zero optics mode, the sine outputs of the half-speed and l6-speed resolvers are routed through a coarse/fine switching network to the motor drive amplifier and are used to null the system. Rate feedback from the motor tachometer is routed to the drive amplifier through a compensation network which removes any bias in the signal. When the zero optics mode is selected, the coupling-data-unit counter and the computer register which contains the shaft angle are zeroed for 15 seconds and then released to follow the l6-speed resolver. The half-speed resolver, the fine/coarse switching network, and the tachometer feedback compensation are used only in the zero optics mode.\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure l4-2.- Zero optics mode circuitry.\\n------\\n'},\n",

The only difficulty in coordinating the training activities was the scheduling of the lunar landing training vehicle for the Commander. The late availability of this vehicle, the large amount of time required for this type of training, and the need to travel between Houston and Cape Kennedy complicated the training Schedule significantly. Because a primary objective was a field geology experiment as part of the second extravehicular excursion, considerable emphasis was placed on geology training.

These excursion were somewhat larger than expected, but simulations have since shown them to be normal and result from engine compliance and mistrim. Spacecraft dynamics were nominal throughout the firing. The first transearth midcourse correction was the last maneuver to use the descent propulsion system. The maneuver was performed by manually controlling pitch and roll using the hand controllers and by automatically controlling yaw with the abort guidance system attitude-hold mode.

An inherent characteristic of this design is that one control cable will nearly always slightly lag the other when the handle is pulled. At full extension of the handle, the travel in each cable assembly is more than sufficient to disengage both plungers and allow both valves to operate.

The reference voltage is applied to the rotor through slip rings (fig. 14-3), connected as shown in figure 14-4. If any resistance is present in the common ground path through the slip ring, a portion of the reference voltage will appear across the quadrature winding and induce a finite output (different than zero). Zero output is equivalent to zero degrees in shaft rotation.\\n\\nSimulated changes in slip ring impedance were made on the half-speed resolver in the shaft loop (fig. 14-4). An impedance of 50 ohms produced an offset of approximately plus 0.5 degree in sextant shaft angle. The trunnion loop does not use this type of resolver or connection.\\n------\\nResult 2:\\nThe testing of the half-speed resolver with resistance in the low side of the sine winding and the vacuum susceptibility exhibited during qualification testing closely duplicate the characteristics of inflight \"zero optics\" operation. The slip-ring mechanism is unique to the shaftaxis, since none of the other resolvers in the system use slip rings. This resolver is in the optics head, which is vented to a vacuum. The rotation of the optics head in a normal operation would wipe the slip rings clean and explain the delay in the fluctuations for some hours after selecting zero optics.\\n\\nCorrective action to high resistance on the brush/slip rings of the resolver is not required since accurate zeroing is unaffected and there is no effect in the operation of the system other than system readout when not in use.

Post-pericynthion navigation procedures were designed to support transearth injection, and special data processing procedures were required for dual vehicle tracking prior to entry. Less range data than usual were received from tracking stations during the abort phase because the power amplifier in the spacecraft was turned off for most of the time to conserve electrical power. The small amounts of range data received and the resulting large data arcs, however, were sufficient to maintain navigation accuracies approximately equivalent to those of Apollo 12.\\n\\n(a) Trans lunar\\n------\\nResult 2:\\nThe unusual spacecraft configuration required that new procedures for entry be developed and verified. The resulting timeline called for a final midcourse correction 5 hours before entry, separation of the service module 4 hours 39 minutes before entry, and undocking of the lunar module at l hour ll minutes before entry. Service module separation was performed using the lunar module reaction control system. Separation velocity following lunar module umdocking was provided using pressure in the docking tunnel.\\n\\nThe final midcourse correction maneuver used the lunar module reaction control system.
