milady themed operations runner with optimized defaults for maximizing cpu+ram+gpu utilization accross a cluster

DISCLAIMER: This tool encapsulates what could be considered "best practices" for... bad practices.

As a distributed computing framework, MiladyOS enables the remote execution of arbitrary code. You should only install MiladyOS workers within networks that you trust. This is standard among distributed computing frameworks, but is worth repeating.

The client is able to download runners, greet milady neibours, create decentralized overlay networks, which then performs any number of Inference/Training tasks. This can potentially be used in a bad manner. Run the client with the least priviliges where possble.

TODO: Drop edith-cli dependency 

## Pachyderm bootrstrapped from [edith-cli](https://github.com/theycallmeloki/edith-cli)

### You will need [this script](https://gist.github.com/theycallmeloki/aa4df404c3df85c31dac91216e22f678) at the end of the edith-cli installation

Add the following to the Dockerfile in the root section and build yourself a container, checkout builder.sh

```
# Add kubeconfig file to the docker
ADD kubeconfig.yaml /root/.kube/config

# Add Pachctl config to the container
COPY config.json /root/.pachyderm/config.json
```
